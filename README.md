## Hardhat vs Foundry

| Feature                        | Hardhat                                 | Foundry                                |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Language                       | JavaScript / TypeScript                | Rust (Forge CLI) + Solidity            |
| Compilation                    | Customizable, slower                   | Very fast (parallel native compiler)   |
| Testing Framework              | Mocha + Chai (JS testing)              | Forge (Solidity native tests)          |
| Deployment                     | Hardhat scripts (JS/TS) or plugins     | Forge scripts (Solidity)               |
| Build Time                     | Moderate                               | Very fast                              |
| Plugins                        | Huge ecosystem (ethers.js, waffle etc) | Fewer plugins (but growing)            |
| Ease of Use                    | Easier for beginners (JS familiar)     | Geared toward advanced users           |
| Setup                          | Needs `npm install` and config files   | Minimal setup (single command)         |
| Gas Reporting                  | Plugin-based                          | Built-in                               |
| Debugging                      | Good (with plugins)                   | Very powerful (stack traces)           |

## Building Smart Contracts: Local IDE vs Remix

| Feature | Local IDE (like VS Code) | Remix IDE (Online) |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Installation | Must install dependencies manually | No installation needed (browser based) |
| Control | Full control over versions, libraries | Limited control |
| Collaboration | Harder unless using Git | Easy (send URL) |
| Debugging | Powerful with extensions | Built-in basic debugger |
| Flexibility | Unlimited customization | Limited to Remix features |
| Offline Access | Yes | No |
| Best For | Large projects, real deployment | Quick prototypes, learning |
